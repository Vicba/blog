description: "Introduction to my blog."
---

Hi! Welcome to my first-ever blog post. I'm excited to start this blog where I'll be writing about myself, my thoughts, and my experiences in school and work.

---

## Why now?
As a typical computer guy, I'm usually anxious and introverted, making it hard for me to put my thoughts and ideas out there to be heard. 

I've always wanted to start a blog, but I never had the confidence to do so. I thought no one would be interested in my  life since I haven't done anything particularly special (except for finishing high school without really studying, which I thought was cool).


However, during my college trip to San Francisco in April 2023, I learned something valuable from Nills, a Belgian working at Microsoft. He said that you should stand out and show that you're unique. So I started thinking about blogging.


Blogging to document my life is a good way to reflect and have a place to store memories, which can help me see how far I've come and how much I've learned. I realized that it's also a good way to think about my past joys and mistakes, and I hope people like me can benefit from my experiences.



## Personal challenges of writing a blog

1. **Improving writing ability:** 
   
   As a Gen Z kid, I have no problem listening and speaking English, thanks to social media and TV shows. However, I want to improve my writing skills and bring my English proficiency to a higher level through this blog.

1. **Building blog in GatsbyJS:** 
   
   When I thought about how to build my blog, I searched for examples and found GatsbyJS. It's a React-based open-source framework specifically built for fast and performant static websites. Since I already know React, I hope that using GatsbyJS won't be a big adjustment, and it can be useful for future projects.



## When is the next post?
I haven't made a schedule for posting yet. I'll probably write when I have a combination of free time and ideas or thoughts I want to share with the world.



## Found a mistake? Have a question? Let me know!
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or notice any grammar mistakes. I'd love to hear your **constructive** feedback!



Stay tuned for my first interesting post about my trip to San Francisco.
