Design is all around us, all the time. Whether its a website on the internet, shape of your chair or the radio button in you're car. You can't escape it! Design has a big impact and is involved in everything we do. It affects how we feel, make decisions and see the world.

## Attention
Attention is like a secret ingredient in design that makes things memorable. Designers use colors, shapes, contrast, and other techniques to catch your eye and create a delightful experience. So, the next time you come across a design that captures your attention, remember that there's a clever designer behind it, using their skills to make the world a more visually exciting place.

The initial impression a design creates can leave a lasting impact. In a highly competitive marketplace, a well-designed product or brand identity can make the difference between attracting customers or being overlooked.



## Images & Colors
In design, images, shapes, and colors are like superheroes that grab your attention, convey emotions and make things look awesome!

Images: Designers choose exciting and eye-catching pictures or illustrations to make their designs more interesting. Have you ever seen a poster or a website with a cool picture that made you want to learn more? That's the power of images in design!

Shapes: Different shapes can make designs stand out. Designers use unique and interesting shapes to catch your eye and make their creations memorable. Whether it's a funky logo or a creative layout, shapes add a touch of creativity to the design.

Colors: Colors are like magic in design. Designers pick vibrant and bold colors to make their creations pop! Have you noticed how some websites or logos use bright colors that instantly grab your attention? That's because colors have the power to make things look exciting and fun.


A thoughtfully designed website is intuitive, easy to navigate, and enjoyable to use. Similarly, well-designed physical products consider ergonomics, functionality, and accessibility, ensuring that users have a seamless and satisfying experience.

A great example is **Airbnb**, where two out of the three founders were professional designers. They implemented a lot of images to the app and gave it a simplistic design.



## Storytelling
Visual storytelling through design elements can capture complex concepts and simplify them, making information more accessible and engaging for the audience. It goes beyond just looking nice, it adds meaning and emotion to the design.

One benefit of storytelling in design is that it helps communicate messages or values in a way that people can understand and remember them. Instead of just showing information, designers use stories to make it more relatable and memorable.

Storytelling also makes designs more fun. It takes you on a journey, like reading a book or watching a movie, making the design feel like an adventure.

Another advantage of storytelling in design is that it can make complicated information easier to understand. By using stories, designers can explain things in a simpler and more interesting way.

Moreover, storytelling in design can make us feel something. It can make us happy or excited. Stories have a way of connecting with our emotions and making the design more special.
