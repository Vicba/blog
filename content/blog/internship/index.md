Internships are like that first step into adulthood, where you mix all the knowledge from school with real-life work stuff. Almost every student has to do them. It's an exciting time where you learn new things, meet new people, and get a taste of what it's like to work in a company. Currently, I'm halfway through my own internship at ML6.

**Origin Story**

So how did it all start? At first I wanted to do my internship in Hong Kong. I knew my school had the Belgian-Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce as a partner from Hong Kong so I reached out to them. Besides this, I also send my resume and motivation letter to 20 companies in the city. I received a few responses but none of them were positive. I was a bit disappointed but I didn't give up.

I had set a deadline for myself to find an internship in Hong Kong by the end of September 2023. Otherwise I would start looking for companies in Belgium.

I went to an internship fair organised by my school where you could speeddate with different companies. That's where I first met ML6 and I was immediately interested.

## Who is ML6?

ML6 is an AI consultancy company that helps businesses to implement AI solutions. They are a team of now 100 people with offices in Ghent, Amsterdam, Berlin and London. They focus on big institutions/companies and help them to implement AI solutions in their business processes. The team consists mainly of data scientists, machine learning engineers and a small amount of software engineers.

## How I got the internship

The onboarding process consisted of 3 steps:

**1. Introduction videos**

To be honest, this was the hardest part of the whole onboarding process. I was a bit nervous to record myself. I had to make a video where I introduce myself, explain what I value, and why I'm studying AI. Then there was a second video where I had to explain why I chose ML6 and which domains within the company I found interesting. This took me a couple of retakes to get it right.

**2. Mug coding challenge**

This is a coding challenge where you have to make a CNN model to classify mugs based on their color.

For me, the coding part was the easiest. I spent the most time testing with Google Cloud Vertex AI. They provided a good readme for this, but the cloud is always a bit tricky.

The threshold for passing the challenge was 75% accuracy. I first got a score of 75.4 and I wasn't really happy with that margin. I wanted to get a score of 80. So I tried a few more things, and I finally got a score of 81.

**3. Interview call**

This last step was a 1-hour call with the squad lead of one of the domains you chose from step 1. They asked me again about my background, my motivation, and my expectations for the internship. They also asked some questions about my personal projects and AI knowledge. At the end, they told me the internship topics that were open, and I could maybe expect to have.

After several weeks of waiting, I finally got the good news that I was accepted for the internship. I was very relieved that I found one and excited to start it at ML6.

## Internship Topic

My internship topic is "evaluation of RAG". For people who don't know what RAG is, it's a combination of techniques that generates answers to your question on a given text. The goal of my internship is to evaluate the performance and use the insights to improve it.

This solution makes searching for information in large text corpuses like pdf's much easier and time saving.

I'm developing a RAG on the intranet of ML6 with GCP. This intranet is a collection of all the documents and other relevant information that is shared within the company. For example, if they have questions about sick leave procedures or travel guidelines to foreign offices, they can ask the RAG and it will give them the answer.

For the evaluation part, there are some metrics that we can use to evaluate the performance. Some can be calculated others use an LLM judge.
Some metrics are: Hit Rate, MRR, MAP, NDCG, Answer relevance, Context relevance, groundedness, etc.

## Learning experience & Collaboration

What I really like about being at ML6 is the brainpower that is present in the company. Everyone is very smart and has a lot of knowledge about AI. This makes it a great place to learn new things. I also like the fact that everyone is very open to help you. If you have a question, you can always ask someone and they will help you. The employees are also very young. The average age is around 28 years old. This makes it a very dynamic and fun place to work.

There's also a lot of freedom. You have your topic and you work on whatever you want. You can ask for help if you need it but you are responsible for your own work. I have a weekly sync with my mentor where I can ask questions and discuss my progress.
They are very flexible with coming to the office. You come to the office when you want, you just need to meet your deadlines.

## Conclusion

I'm feeling great about my internship. Looking forward to the next few months! Now at the time of writing this, I start the 2 week easter vacation where I'll mostly work on my bachelor thesis. A little rest before the final sprint of my internship.
