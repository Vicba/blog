I believe that reading is a path to personal growth. It improves our understanding of the world and ourselves. Books can create new ideas and encourage reflection on our experiences. They introduce us to different perspectives and expand our knowledge, helping us become better individuals.

This is a list of books I have read and recommend. I will add books to this list every year.
