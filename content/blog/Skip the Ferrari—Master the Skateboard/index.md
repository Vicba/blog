Why Every Startup Needs to Learn to Ride Before Hitting the Autobahn

---


It might seem obvious but apparently many people let their excitement run away with them when they start building something. I recently met someone showcasing his brand-new SaaS product: slick animations, flawless UI, the whole shebang. My first thought was “Wow, that must have taken months of work.” But after going through side-projects, late-night coding sprints, and far too much caffeine, I’ve discovered that going straight for perfection is the greatest trap of all. It’s like trying to drive a Ferrari before you’ve learned to ride a bike.

When you start building something, you’re at the skateboard stage. It’s clunky, unstable, maybe held together with duct tape. You can’t win any races, but you learn how to balance. This is your prototype, the raw, disposable proof of concept. It doesn’t matter if the code is ugly or the buttons look like they came from the ‘90s. What matters is that you put something real in front of a handful of users and ask: Does this solve your problem.

Here’s where most people get it wrong: they spend weeks perfecting the UI, architecting a rock-solid backend, or wrangling complex systems long before knowing if their idea even clicks. I’ve seen prototypes with polished animations crash and burn because nobody cared about all those bells and whistles. The goal of a prototype isn’t scale or security. It’s learning fast. If your sketch-turned-mockup flops, scrap it, iterate or pivot. Prototypes are meant to be disposable, not forever monuments to your ego.

When you kick off a project, you’re at the skateboard stage: wobbly, barebones, maybe duct-taped together. This is your prototype, your throwaway proof of concept. The code can be ugly, the interface rough, but you need real feedback fast. If you spend weeks polishing that UI or architecting a fortress-grade backend, you’ll waste time on features that might never matter. Prototypes exist to learn, not to impress.

Here’s a shortcut to stripping out the bullshit and zeroing in on the core: the five-day Sprint process from Jake Knapp’s book Sprint. You gather a small team, map the problem, sketch solutions, choose the best sketch, build a realistic prototype, and test it with real users. All in one week. No drawn-out debates, no over-engineering, just rapid focused learning.

Once you’ve proven that people smile and say “Hey, I’d pay for this,” you graduate to your MVP, or Minimum Viable Product. Think of it as a sturdy bicycle: more reliable than a skateboard but not yet a motorbike. An MVP should solve the one core pain point end-to-end. No frills, no feature creep. Yet I’ve watched people load up their MVP with every idea they’ve ever had, trying to match the features of industry giants. They launch months late, baffled that users don’t stick around. The “minimum” in MVP is your anchor: deliver only what’s essential, then obsessively track activation, retention, and willingness to pay.

After your MVP proves its worth, early adopters are signing up, engaging, and even paying, you finally earn the right to build your “motorbike.” This is the full product stage: refined UI, scalable infrastructure, robust security, and a roadmap of advanced features. But here’s the problem: scaling too fast without maintaining that feedback loop means you end up with a bloated, feature-heavy mess. You add every request, skip fixing old issues, and chase shallow numbers like total downloads instead of focusing on real user activity. Before you know it, your “Ferrari” sputters and comes to a stop on the startup highway.

So what’s the secret? It’s really simple: iterate relentlessly, stay ruthlessly focused, and keep talking to your users at every stage. From skateboard to scooter to bike to motorbike and, yes, eventually that Ferrari, each step teaches you something new about your users, your technology, and your own assumptions.
- Prototype: Embrace ugliness. Code fast, fail fast, and be ready to kill your darlings.
- MVP: Laser-focus on the killer feature. Ship early, measure obsessively, and let data guide your next move.
- Product: Polish with purpose. Prioritize ruthless pruning of bloat, invest in stability, and never lose sight of the core problem you set out to solve.

When I sketch out new ideas, I no longer crave a supercar right away. I crave the scraps of wood and wheels that teach me how to roll.

Because only by mastering each vehicl, each stage, can you one day earn the keys to the real supercar.
